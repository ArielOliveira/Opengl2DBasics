## About
- A basic OpenGL setup based on an assignment. The project features matrix operations like translation, rotation and scaling, also
abstraction of OpenGL buffer objects, array objects, shaders and demonstrates a simple GLSL code. The output is a 2D opened up dice image
which can be rotated, translated or scaled by pressing a key on the keyboard.
          
## Execution
- Rotation:     key A
- Tranlsation:  key B
- Reset Camera: key C
- Zoom out (from face 1): key D
- Zoom in (to face 6): key E
- Rotate: Key F
- Move all other faces away from face 1: key G
